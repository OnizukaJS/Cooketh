## Description

Lazy to cook? Got a last-minute dinner at home and you are out of ideas? This website gathers a community of nearby cooks to cook for you anyday, anytime, any cooking style.

Find a recipe you like, select your zone, a day, and hour, number of guests to please and send a request to the cook.
Once accepted, just wait for the day, relax and let the cook do the work.

Or sign-up as a cook and offer your awesome skills to the rest of the world: upload your specialties, take some neat pictures of your dishes (and you), fill up your profile and get ready to make some coins and friends.

Everybody wins.
